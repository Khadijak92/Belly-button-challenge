# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This project is a web-based dashboard that allows users to explore belly button biodiversity data. The dashboard provides interactive charts to visualize different aspects of the data, such as demographic information, bacterial sample data, and belly button washing frequency.

## Introduction
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is built using JavaScript, D3.js, and Plotly.js libraries. It fetches data from an external JSON file containing information about bacterial samples collected from participants' belly buttons. The dashboard consists of multiple interactive charts, including:

- Demographic Information: Displays metadata information about the selected participant, such as age, gender, and ethnicity.
- Bar Chart: Visualizes the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in the selected participant's belly button.
- Bubble Chart: Illustrates the distribution of bacterial samples based on OTU IDs and sample values.
- Gauge Chart: Represents the belly button washing frequency of the selected participant.

## Features
- Dynamic dropdown menu for selecting participants.
- Real-time updating of charts based on the selected participant.
- Interactive charts with hover tooltips for detailed information.
- Responsive layout for optimal viewing on various devices.
